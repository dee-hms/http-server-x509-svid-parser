## Introduction
Tang IAM proxy is an HTTPS proxy that parses X509 client certificate and
extracts SVID from Subject Alternate Names extension.
Main purpose of the proxy is to show how to extract previous information
from certificates generated by an SPIRE agent.
In this document it is explained how to generate required scripts for
the proxy server, and how to run `curl` application to act
as a client that sends the agent certificate.
The HTTPS server will parse client certificate, and will dump the
corresponding parsed information. It will also check in database
if receiving SPIRE ID is registered and, if so, it will forward the request
to the Tang server specified as parameter.
Database supported is [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html),
essentially due to two aspects:
* It provides a very simple mechanism to be configured
* It has a very small footprint, which makes it suitable to be used
in [ConsoleDot](https://github.com/RedHatInsights)

## Certificate generation
The script `generate-signed-certificate.sh` has been included to generate
the corresponding certificates.
It can be provided a parameter to name the certificates.
Otherwise, the naming used will be *server*.

Usage of the script is as follows:

```bash
$ ./generate-signed-certificate.sh -h

./generate-signed-certificate.sh [-n name] [-s subAlternateName] [-h] [-v]

Examples:
        ./generate-signed-certificate.sh -n server -s tang-iam-proxy-passthrough

Options:
        -n "name": Base name for generated files
        -s "subAlternateName": extra Subject Alternate Name for server certificate
        -h: help
        -v: verbose
```

To generate the certificates, execute the script:

```bash
$ ./generate-signed-certificate.sh
*************************
certname:server
sub_alternate_name:tang-server-deployment
*************************
Certificate request self-signature ok
subject=C = ES, ST = Madrid, L = Madrid, O = Red Hat, OU = org, CN = www.redhat.com
```

The script will generate a collection of certificates. The ones that will be used are:

* `ca_server_cert.pem`: This file will be used as the CA certificate
* `server_bundle.pem`: File that will act as the server certificate
* `server.key`: File that will be used as the server private key

The script can be provided a different subject alternate name to store in server's certificate:

```bash
$ ./generate-signed-certificate.sh -s tang-iam-proxy-passthrough-ephemeral-012345.apps.c-rh-c-eph.1a0b.p1.openshiftapps.com
*****************************************
certname:server
sub_alternate_name:tang-iam-proxy-passthrough-ephemeral-012345.apps.c-rh-c-eph.1a0b.p1.openshiftapps.com
*****************************************
Certificate request self-signature ok
subject=C = ES, ST = Madrid, L = Madrid, O = Red Hat, OU = org, CN = www.redhat.com
```

## Compilation
Tang IAM proxy can be compiled through `make` tool.
`Makefile` exists so that it eases the compilation,
required certificates and the container generation:

```bash
$ make
mkdir -p root/usr/bin
echo "0.0.1" > root/version.txt
cp tang-iam-entrypoint.sh root/usr/bin
cp tang-iam-health-check.sh root/usr/bin
cp tang_bindings.db root/usr/bin
go build -o root/usr/bin/tang-iam-proxy tang_iam_proxy.go
./generate-signed-certificate.sh -s "tang-iam-proxy-passthrough"
*****************************************
certname:server
sub_alternate_name:tang-iam-proxy-passthrough

```
As shown previously, current version is `0.0.1`.
`Makefile` can be parameterized with two parameters:
* VERSION: To generate a different version
* SUB_ALT_NAME: To include an additional Subject Alternate Name
in the server certificate.
An example of a full parameterized compilation execution
is shown below:

```bash
$ VERSION=0.0.2 SUB_ALT_NAME=tang-iam-proxy-passthrough-ephemeral-123-456-789.openshiftapps.com make

## Proxy execution
The proxy has next usage:

```bash
$ ./tang-iam-proxy -help

usage:

tang_iam_proxy -serverCert <serverCertificateFile> -serverKey <serverPrivateKeyFile> -tangServer <tangServer>
               [-port <port>] [-dbFile <dbfile>] [-httpUser <httpuser>] [-httpPass <httppass>] [-insecure] [-internal] [-help] [-verbose]

Options:
  -help       Optional, prints help message
  -dbFile     Optional, defaults to /var/lib/sqlite/tang_bindings.db
  -httpUser   Optional, http user, defaults to jdoe
  -httpPass   Optional, http password, defaults to jdoe123
  -insecure   Optional, insecure more
  -internal   Optional, disabled by default
  -port       Optional, the HTTPS port for the server to listen on, defaults to 443
  -serverCert Mandatory (except for insecure mode), server's certificate file
  -serverKey  Mandatory (except for insecure mode), server's private key certificate file
  -tangServer Mandatory, tang server location in form host:port
  -verbose    Optional, be more verbose
```

Taking into account the certificates generated in section [Certificate generation](#certificate-generation), the
server will be executed as follows:

```bash
$ ./tang-iam-proxy -internal -dbFile /var/lib/sqlite/tang_bindings.db -port 8887 -serverCert server_bundle.pem --serverKey server.key -tangServer tang-server-deployment:8000
...
2023/07/28 17:15:08 Connected to DB!
2023/07/28 17:15:08 Sending requests to tang-server-deployment:8000
2023/07/28 17:15:08 URL:[http://tang-server-deployment:8000]
...
```

It must be highlighted that server certificate (`server_bundle.pem`) already contains the CA certificate, so it is not necessary
to provide it to the server in an additional parameter.


## Agent certificates
The main purpose of this server application is to show how SVID in an SPIRE agent certificate can be parsed.
The agent private key and certificate is generated by the SPIRE agent once server attests its correctly.
It is not the aim of this document to document the whole SPIRE server attestation. To do so, refer to the
[References](#references)) section.

SPIRE agent generates the certificate and the keys normally in `data` directory:
```bash
$ spire-agent run -config spire-1.6.4/conf/agent/agent.conf
...
$ tree data/agent/
data/agent/
├── agent-data.json
├── agent_svid.der
├── bundle.der
└── keys.json
```

From previous directory, the files to used in client will be:
* `agent_svid.der`: This file will be used as it appears.
* `keys.json`: This file contains the private key of the agent. However, as it is not in the format that `curl` would expect,
the key has to be extracted to an `agent.key` file with the corresponding prefix and suffix. `keys.json` has next format:

```bash
$ cat data/agent/keys.json
{
        "keys": {
                "agent-svid-A": "MIGHAgE...LoNg_KeY_HeRe_123a_...LuymQw"
        }
}
```

The agent key provided to curl will be of the format:

```bash
$ cat agent.key
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
MIGHAgE...LoNg_KeY_HeRe_123a_...LuymQw
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----

## SVID identification
To check if server is parsing SVID correctly, agent certificate can be read with `openssl` tool, so that
Subject Alternate Name URI is obtained:

```bash
openssl x509 -inform der  -in ./agent_svid.der  --text | grep -i "Subject Alternative Name:" -A1
            X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
                URI:spiffe://example.org/spire/agent/aws_iid/12977789345/us-east-1/i-1234d7bdff825678
```
The URI string `spiffe://example.org/spire/agent/aws_iid/12977789345/us-east-1/i-1234d7bdff825678` is the
one that needs to be obtained in server. In case that line can be parsed, it will be demonstrated that the
information can be programmatically parsed. Next section covers how to use `curl` tool to use SPIRE agent
private key and certificate to access the HTTPS server.

## Client simulation through curl tool
Previous section showed how to obtain `curl` required files to access HTTPS server, so that it can parse
the SVID that was assigned to an agent.

For `curl` to access the HTTPS server that was started as described in Section [Server execution](#server-execution),
the command to use will be next:

```bash
$ curl --cert agent_svid.der --cert-type der --cacert ca_server_cert.pem --key ./agent.key --verbose https://localhost:8082
...
*  SSL certificate verify ok.
...
< HTTP/2 200
...
```
A description on how to get each of the files used by `curl` was performed on the previous sections.
As it can be observed in previous command, curl will dump SSL certificate verification works appropriately, and server will send
a 200 OK response with no content.
If everything works as expected HTTPS server will dump the information of the agent certificate, and print the SVID in the console:
```
2023/01/02 03:06:09
2023/01/02 03:06:18 Starting HTTPS server, port:[8082]
2023/01/02 03:06:18 Received GET request for host localhost:8082 from IP address 127.0.0.1:45738

2023/01/02 03:06:18    i:/C=[US]/ST=[]/L=[]/O=[SPIFFE]/OU=[]/CN=
2023/01/02 03:06:18    SAN URL:[spiffe://example.org/spire/agent/aws_iid/12977789345/us-east-1/i-1234d7bdff825678]
2023/01/02 03:06:18 **************** /Connection State ****************
```

This way, forward implementation of a proxy that uses SVID to forward agent requests can be implemented.
